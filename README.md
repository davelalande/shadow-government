# DOGE Audit: Operation Transparency

A text-based simulation game where you lead the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) in investigating corruption and promoting transparency. This game explores the challenges of exposing financial misconduct while maintaining public trust.

## Background

This game is inspired by current events involving government auditing and transparency initiatives. The simulation incorporates:
- AI-powered financial forensics
- Cryptocurrency transaction tracking
- NGO network analysis
- Whistleblower protection
- Public trust building
- Evidence gathering and validation

## Features

- Fully dynamic scenarios generated by GPT-4 API
- Real-time metric tracking:
  - Transparency (public disclosure level)
  - Public Trust (community confidence)
  - Evidence (gathered proof)
- Two gameplay modes:
  - Interactive: Make your own investigative choices
  - Auto Mode: Watch AI conduct the investigation
- ASCII art progress bars
- Intelligent fallback events if API is unavailable
- AI analysis of your decisions

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/davelalande/shadow-government.git
```

2. Install required dependencies:
```bash
pip install openai
```

3. Set up your OpenAI API key as an environment variable:
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-api-key-here'
```

## Usage

Run the game:
```bash
python shadow.py
```

Choose your mode at startup:
- `I` for Interactive mode (manual investigation)
- `A` for Auto mode (AI-driven investigation)

## Gameplay

Your mission is to expose corruption while balancing three key metrics:
- Transparency (0-100): How open your investigation is with the public
- Public Trust (0-100): The community's confidence in your work
- Evidence (0-100): The strength of your case against corruption

Each turn presents a scenario with two possible approaches. Choose carefully - your decisions shape the future of transparency!

The game provides:
- Dynamic scenarios based on current events
- AI analysis of your choices
- Strategic feedback
- Progress tracking
- Multiple paths to success

## Development Notes

- Uses OpenAI's GPT-4 API for:
  - Scenario generation
  - Choice analysis
  - Strategic decision-making
- Intelligent fallback system for API failures
- Modular design for easy expansion
